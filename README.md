Save them is an Andoid app designed to help it's users to learn about endangered species and what to do in order to protect them.
It's main feature is an interactive encyclopedia where useres can add sightings of sumbit information of an endangered species. It also allows the user to get informed about Non Profit Organizations( also known as MKO in Greek) and their current or/and future actions. The user can also contribute to their work by purchasing an item of their choice from the app's integrated eshop. In addition the in-app QR reader can scan codes from protected sightings and learn more about them.
